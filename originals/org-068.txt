This article discusses the potential dangers of artificial intelligence (AI) and argues that it must be stopped. While AI offers many benefits, such as improving energy solutions and accessibility to information, the negative consequences outweigh the short-term advantages. The author highlights missed opportunities in the past to prevent the negative impacts of technologies like automobiles and toxic chemicals. The article explores various risks associated with AI, including extreme genetic engineering, threats to the financial system, lethal autonomous weapons, economic inequality, environmental impact, and the erosion of human relationships. The author calls for a total ban on AI and suggests that it could prompt a reevaluation of neoliberal capitalism and the need to address other existential threats.
