Machine learning has revolutionized the video game industry by offering artificial intelligence capabilities that enhance the player experience and gameplay.
One of the most notable applications is the creation of more realistic and adaptive non-player characters (NPCs). With machine learning algorithms,
NPCs can learn from player behavior, adjust their strategies and difficulty levels in real-time, providing more dynamic challenges and immersive gaming experiences.
Additionally, machine learning is used to personalize the player experience, from content recommendations to difficulty adjustments based on individual performance,
ensuring that each gaming session is unique and satisfying for the user.
