In this article, we introduce a model for adjustable moisture control specifically designed for historical buildings. The proposed system is developed as a flexible IoT infrastructure, equipped with a complex network of sensors to monitor indoor humidity levels and compare them with groundwater levels, rainfall, and wind speed to manage a drying system. The control model employs type-2 fuzzy logic reasoning, enabling it to adapt decisions based on the intensity of water absorption. This innovative model thus provides an intelligent system for managing interior conditions in historical buildings. The system was installed and tested in an old brewery building, and research results demonstrate its efficiency in dehumidification at minimal cost.
