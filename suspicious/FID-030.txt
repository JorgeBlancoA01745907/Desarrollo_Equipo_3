Artificial intelligence chatbots have invaded the tourism industry owing to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the influence of emotional expressions of chatbots on service outcomes has not received much attention from researchers. Drawing upon expectancy violations theory, we explored how emotional expressions of chatbots affect customer satisfaction using three experiments in the context of tourist attraction recommendations. Chatbots' expressions of concern for customers can improve customer satisfaction by reducing expectancy violations. In particular, customer's goal orientation, the human-likeness of chatbot's avatars, and the relationship type between customers and chatbots can moderate the negative relationship between emotional expression and expectancy violation.
Furthermore, our study highlights the necessity for tourism companies to carefully design chatbot interactions to align with customers' expectations, ensuring a balance between efficiency and empathetic communication. By incorporating emotional intelligence into chatbot design, tourism businesses can not only enhance customer satisfaction but also foster stronger, more personalized connections with their clientele. Our research suggests that future studies should delve deeper into the nuances of chatbot-customer interactions, exploring how different emotional cues and contexts can further influence customer experiences and service outcomes in the tourism sector.
