This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of the research and application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in recommender systems (RS). The study aims to identify recent trends, explore real-life applications, and guide researchers in positioning their research activities in this domain, covering publications from January to June 2023. The findings are categorized into various domains, including education, healthcare, ML algorithms (such as auto-encoders and reinforcement learning), e-commerce, and digital journalism. The review emphasizes the improved recommendation accuracy, increased scalability, personalization, and context awareness, as well as the diverse ML techniques and strategies for handling cold start and data sparsity. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for future advancements in ML algorithms for RSs, particularly in the context of manufacturing enterprises.
