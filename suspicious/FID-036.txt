This article examines the benefits and risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education in relation to fundamental human rights. The article is based on an EU scoping study [Berendt, B., A. Littlejohn, P. Kern, P. Mitros, X. Shacklock, and M. Blakemore. 2017. Big Data for Monitoring Educational Systems. Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union. https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/94cb5fc8-473e-11e7-aea8-01aa75ed71a1/]. The study takes into account the potential for AI and ‘Big Data’ to provide more effective monitoring of the education system in real-time, but also considers the implications for fundamental human rights and freedoms of both teachers and learners. The analysis highlights a need to balance the benefits and risks as AI tools are developed, marketed, and deployed. A conclusion is drawn with a call to embed consideration of the benefits and risks of AI in education as technology tools into the development, marketing, and deployment of these tools. Questions are raised about who – which body or organization – should take responsibility for regulating AI in education, particularly since AI impacts not only data protection and privacy but fundamental rights in general. Given AI’s global impact, it is argued that regulation should occur at a trans-national level, with a global organization such as the UN taking on this role.
