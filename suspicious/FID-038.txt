Evolutionary computation, a sub-field of artificial intelligence and artificial life, is characterized by the use of biologically inspired methods to solve optimization problems through iterative refinements of a set of solutions via change and selection. This approach, which began in the 1950s, comprises a growing set of algorithms capable of solving a wide range of problems, divided into various types differing in selection, mutation, and representation of candidate solutions. Successful applications have been recorded in multiple domains, including optimization, machine learning, robotics, and various areas that study living systems. Evolutionary computation has recently experienced a revival, particularly in the study of open-ended evolution, with significant implications for the future of AI. It has the unique potential to generate endless innovations and lead to a paradigm shift in the development of artificial intelligence and artificial life.
