Over the past decades, the number of vehicles on the road has consistently increased due to the growing demand for urban mobility and modern logistics. This surge in vehicles has led to significant issues such as heightened traffic congestion and increased traffic accidents, both of which hinder economic development. These challenges can be effectively addressed by making vehicles smarter and reducing their dependence on human drivers. Over the past century, extensive research conducted by various nations has propelled the automation of road vehicles. Today, major motor manufacturers worldwide are actively developing autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies. With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the widespread adoption of autonomous cars is closer than we might expect. AI has become a critical element for AVs, enabling them to perceive their environment and make real-time decisions accurately. This progress in AI is being fueled by the proliferation of big data from numerous sensing devices and advanced computing resources. To fully understand AI's role in AV systems, it is essential to explore its development and historical context.
