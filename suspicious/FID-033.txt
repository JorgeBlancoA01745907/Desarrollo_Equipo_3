Artificial General Intelligence is the idea that someday an hypothetical agent will arise from artificial intelligence (AI) progresses, and will surpass by far the brightest and most gifted human minds. This idea has been around since the early development of AI. Since then, scenarios on how such AI may behave towards humans have been the subject of many fictional and research works.  This work presents two significant advances: a unique method for determining a player's specific fears via game data and machine learning methods and an adaptive game system that employs agents to monitor players' terror experiences and restrict exposure to components that they find upsetting. Additional evidence from user studies and statistical significance testing suggests that our method may boost the stress and anxiety felt by gamers, resulting in rewarding gaming experience. In particular, we focus on 3 specific families of modern AIs to develop the idea that deep neural networks, which are the current backbone of nearly all artificial intelligence methods, are poor candidates for any AGI to arise due to their many limitations, and therefore that any threat coming from the recent AI race does not lie in AGI but in the limitations, uses, and lack of regulations of our current models and algorithms. An endeavor of this kind has the potential to advance state of VR and artificial intelligence in gaming while also offering exciting and memorable adventures for gamers.
