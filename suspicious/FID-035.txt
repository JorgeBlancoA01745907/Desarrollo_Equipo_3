While Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research has aimed to support student learning, experiences from other AI domains suggest that such ethical intentions alone are insufficient. It is necessary to explicitly consider issues like fairness, accountability, transparency, bias, autonomy, agency, and inclusion. More generally, it is important to distinguish between doing ethical things and doing things ethically, understanding and making pedagogical choices that are ethical, and accounting for the possibility of unintended consequences. However, addressing these and related questions is far from simple. As a first step towards addressing this critical gap, we invited 60 of the AIED communityâ€™s leading researchers to respond to a survey on ethics and the application of AI in educational contexts. In this paper, we first introduce issues surrounding the ethics of AI in education. Next, we summarize the contributions of the 17 respondents and discuss the complex issues they raised. Specific outcomes include the recognition that most AIED researchers are not trained to tackle emerging ethical questions. A well-designed framework for engaging with the ethics of AIED, combining a multidisciplinary approach and a set of robust guidelines, seems vital in this context.
