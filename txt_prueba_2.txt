From primitive caves and mud huts to modern skyscrapers and smart homes, the evolution of housing reflects the progress of humanity. In ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptian and Mesopotamian, houses were simple and functional, primarily designed to protect their inhabitants from the elements. Over time, construction techniques advanced, allowing for the creation of more complex and durable structures. In the Middle Ages, castles and mansions reflected the status and power of their owners, while cottages and huts were common among peasants.
