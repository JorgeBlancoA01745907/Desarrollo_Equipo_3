Recent innovations in Human-Centric Functional Modeling (HCFM) seek to represent natural phenomena in terms of graphs called “functional state spaces” or FSS that consist of discrete states of functionality separated by the interactions through which regions of matter and/or antimatter transition from one state of functionality to another. These approaches are called “human-centric” because it is hypothesized that the human organism is constrained by the laws of thermodynamics to perceive the observable world in terms of FSS, where in each FSS all processes consist of a minimally reducible set of reversible operations or functions. These hypothetical FSS are networks. In simulating physical processes, or processes in any other domain in which the abstract functionality of systems can be represented in terms of FSS, it is hypothesized that network effects create the potential to significantly or even exponentially increase the general problem-solving ability of human groups. The goal of this monograph is to encourage exploration of how components of these theories might align with emerging or established scientific concepts.
